    ticket: 32
    desc: >
      Local scoreboard is the "bread and butter" report that most team
      members will look at. It contains the status of the six major
      games, broken down by week for the whole quarter.

      Look at any stats sheet to get the games for this.

  LocalTeamExpansion:

    scope: local

      Application status is the breakdown of every current T1X and T2X
      applicants and where they are in their application process.

    desc: >
      From Kyle in response to my question - No, just extract it from the source and display it as needed.
      The more detail in this area is crucial.

    ticket: 38
    questions:
      - is this report the north america sheet - scoreboard tab?
    desc: >
      This scoreboard shows the current quarter for the region for the
      six major games; broken up by week and each column pair shows
      promise/actual for a week within the quarter.

      Effectively, it is almost exactly the local scoreboard except
      the promise/actual is the summation of the totals for the region.

  RegionRegEffectiveness:
    name: Summary Registration Effectiveness - % of closed courses
    scope: regional
    access: [global, global_leader, program_manager]
    questions:
      - Is this report the same as `North America Sheet -> Registration Fulfillment`?
    desc: >
      For courses upcoming and closed courses, for this quarter, each city in
      its own row, this report shows the registration fulfillment effectiveness
      of CAP courses and the percentage of courses above and below the 80% reg
      fulfillment mark.

      In addition, the existing report shows outstanding apps and apps that
      have not moved for T1X and T2x

  RegionCAPRegVsTDO:
    name: Summary % of TDO against the number of CAP registrations for the week.
    scope: regional
    access: [global, global_leader]
    desc: >
      From Kyle: Yes this will be combined in the existing report.
      It is all around the participants.  For each team, how many registrations were
      made for those attending TDO for the week.

      It should look something like
      Team    | Total T1 | T1 Attending | Total T2 | T2 Attending | Total CAP Reg | CAP Reg / TDO% |
      Seattle |       19 |          14  |    12    |          11  |           3   |     12%        |
